# inGaia Front-end Test 01

## Requirements
- [x] MarkoJS
- [x] Responsiveness
- [x] Youtube API
- [x] Unit tests (only a few of them, quick note: Markojs doesn't make easy to play with the UTs)

## Tips
- [x] Animations
- [x] Coverage (not 100% due to the difficulty to write UTs and interact with the components from there).
- [x] e2e (only 1, they're easy to write but I have no time to do more as I'd like, 'cause Cypress rocks!)
- [ ] CI :(

## Commands
- npm start - Run the web server
- npm test - Run the unit tests
- npm run cov - Run the unit tests displaying the coverage report
- npm run e2e - Run the e2e/integration tests
