# inGaia Front-end Test 01

## Requirements
- [x] MarkoJS
- [x] Responsiveness
- [x] Youtube API
- [x] Unit tests (only a few of them, Markojs is really hard to get the working for UTs haha)

## Tips
- [x] Animations
- [x] Coverage (not 100% due to the dificulty to write UTs and interact with the components from there).
- [x] e2e (only 1, they're easy to write but I have no time to do more as I'd like, 'cause Cypress rocks!)
- [ ] CI :(
